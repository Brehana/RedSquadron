TCSS-360 Projects

Hi guys! This is where we will collaborate and work on our project!

To get started, you are going to want to set up a programming environment. This involves picking
a text editor of your choice (Eclipse, Visual Studio, notepad++, etc...) and connecting it to this repository
via "cloning".

Under the "<> Code" tab, you'll see a big green button with a couple links. I'd recommend using the HTTPS if your
operating system is anything other than linux. Most IDE's (previously called text editors) have an interface for interacting
with github built in, so googling "How to connect to a github repository in [TEXT EDITOR NAME HERE]" should yield some useful
tutorials.

If you're new to using source control, here is some important terminology and their definitions:

"Clone a repository": Loads the files stored in the repository onto a location in your computer. Once this local repository is created,
do not mess with it outside your text editor, it will prevent you from communicating with again.

"Fetch": Checks to see if anyone's made any changes to the remote repository on Github.

"Pull": Downloads the most recent version of the files stored in the remote repository. This will overwrite the files in your local repository.

"Push": Uploads (and replaces) the files stored in your computer to the remote repository. This will overwrite the files in the remote repository.
Be careful not to delete your teammates work!

"Sync": Pull, then push. Necessary each time to prevent two contributors pushing the same change to the repository.

You can test your setup the same way you can test your compilers, by saying hello! Create a .txt file, name it [YOUR NAME]_HelloTeam.txt, save it
to your local repository, then sync with the remote repository. You should see your text file appear here under "Pull requests" where we can
double check your update won't create any conflicts.
